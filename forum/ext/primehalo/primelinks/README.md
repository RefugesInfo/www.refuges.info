# Prime Links

## Synopsis

A phpBB 3.1/3.2/3.3 extension that modifies the attributes of links within posts (and/or private messages) based on whether the links are internal or external. This allows setting different classes so internal and external links look different, setting a target so links open in a new window, setting a nofollow, prefixing URLs such as to add an anonymizer or monetizer, and more.

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP file.
2. Unzip and copy to the `ext` directory of your phpBB board so that you have `ext/primehalo/primelinks`.
3. Navigate in the ACP to `Customise -> Manage extensions`.
4. Look for `Prime Links` under the Disabled Extensions list, and click its `Enable` link.
5. Configure settings by navigating in the ACP to `Extensions` -> `Prime Links`.
