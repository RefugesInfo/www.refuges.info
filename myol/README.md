Layers keys
===========
If you want to use external providers layers, you must acquire free keys and replace them in the html (see source comment)
* French IGN : Get your own (free) IGN key at [https://geoservices.ign.fr/](https://geoservices.ign.fr/)
* OSM thunderforest : Get your own (free) THUNDERFOREST key at [https://manage.thunderforest.com](https://manage.thunderforest.com)
* Microsoft BING : Get your own (free) BING key at [https://www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/create-a-bing-maps-key)

Architecture
============
Just include myol.js & myos.css after ol/dist, proj4js & geocoder's js & css.
* See this [example](https://DC92.github.io/MyOl/examples/index.html)
* Code & all tiled layers use EPSG:3857 spherical mercator projection

The coding rules are volontary simple & don't follow all openlayers's
* No JS classes, no jquery, no es6 modules, no nodejs build, no minification, no npm repository, ...
* Each adaptation is included in a single JS function that you can include separately (check dependencies if any)
* Feel free to use, modify & share as you want
